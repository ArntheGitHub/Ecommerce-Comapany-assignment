# Ecommerce-Company-assignment
The company hired us to help them analize the data they have and gain valuable information to improve and increase the sales.

In order to achieve this we will use different approaches, that include analyzing the correlations between the different features and fitting models to understand the feature importance. With this we will be able to answer the following questions:

- Should the company focus their efforts on their mobile app experience or their website? 

- Are the in-store sessions useful?

- Where should the company focus their advertising campaign?
